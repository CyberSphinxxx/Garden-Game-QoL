# ⚠️ Project Status Update: Major Refactor & Compliance

**Status:** 🚧 *Under Construction / Refactoring* 🚧

## What is happening?

Following a productive and positive conversation with the development team behind **Magic Garden**, I have decided to take this project in a new direction.

The original goal of this project was to explore OpenCV and Python automation. However, as an aspiring developer myself, I understand that full 24/7 automation of major gameplay mechanics harms the game's economy and creates unsustainable server costs for an indie studio.

To respect the developers and the longevity of the game, **I am voluntarily refactoring this project.**

## Changes Incoming

The repository is currently being overhauled to strictly adhere to the official [Magic Garden Policy for Mods & Scripts](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/808935495543160852/1428205518278885457/1428205518278885457).

### What is being removed:
* **Full AFK Automation:** The "infinite loop" farming, harvesting, and idling mechanics are being permanently removed.
* **Game Assets:** All copyrighted game images and assets used for template matching will be removed.
* **The Name:** The project will be rebranded to distinguish it from official game products.

### What is being added (The Pivot):
We are pivoting from a "Bot" to an "Assistant." The new version will focus on **Quality of Life (QoL)** tools that are explicitly allowed under the game's modding policy, such as:
* **Smart Analytics:** using OpenCV to calculate yields and optimization strategies without interacting with the game client.
* **Notifications:** "Discord Notifier" alerts for when manual intervention is actually needed.
* **Pet Management:** Limited assistance for pet mechanics (as permitted by policy).

## To Current Users
Thank you for your interest in the code. Please understand that this pivot is necessary to keep the project alive and fair. If you are looking for a cheat tool or AFK bot, this repository will no longer serve that purpose.

If you are interested in legitimate QoL tools and computer vision engineering, stay tuned for **v4.0**.
